# UFOs

## Purpose

We have built a webpage with a dynamic table(information filters and table updates according to user selected inputs) in order to help Dana provide an in-depth analysis to support her journalism article around UFOs sightings. We have used Javascript and D3.js along with HTML, bootstrap and some CSS to help us build a user-friendly web-page that gives impactful supports to Dana's article.

## Results

The webpage has a clean layout and presents the reader with Dana's article to start off and once they scroll down, the user can view the table with UFO sighting data, and towards the left of the table, input fields to filter the table.
